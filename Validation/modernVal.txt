Like her?
What do you want?
Answer me straightforwardly.
Mend” me, you impertinent fellow?
Don’t say anything else.
If I had seen something like that, I would have quickly pulled out my weapon.
Is this really happening?
Really?
He and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house.
Come with me, sir.
When I talked about all these things, Desdemona used to listen attentively.
Believe me, my friend, since I have the power to stop the prosecutors.
I demand this in the name of all the saints in heaven.
And I believe—unless this brain of mine is not so politically cunning as it used to be—that I’ve found out why Hamlet’s gone crazy.
Who’s there?
Ratcliffe, come here.
That’s a nice hand you dealt me.
This would be enough to make my husband suspect me, if he wasn’t so free of jealousy.
Don’t worry about the cost.
Hurry up, Robin, and make the night dark and cloudy.
You’re in a bad mood?
There’s no room for the old man and his followers.
Now, your gown?
You should go to Juliet and dress her up.
That day will never come.
I’ll hound him.
Don’t speak of this again.
Let’s follow them to see how this turns out.
My lord, I will give them all they deserve.
Did you talk with this woman?
Lord Hastings, you and he are close.
We follow in your orbit, and you have the power to move us.
Here I am.
Gratiano talks more nonsense than any other man in Venice.
Shame of what, lady?
Portia, are you really gone?
Hurry, hurry—prepare my horse.
Mantua.
Be at ease.
Alas, I hate myself instead, because of the hateful deeds I’ve committed.
Stanley, pay attention to your wife’s doings.
We should rip off your man’s clothing and show the world the woman who has represented her own kind so badly.
Just one glass.
Who are you?
Will you be crowned tomorrow?
Since you’re old and respected, you should be wise.
Good morning, neighbor Baptista.
But I will tell you that I seduced Margaret, the Lady Hero’s waiting woman, tonight.
Oh, I’m very scared something awful has happened.
I like doing things the old-fashioned way.
Come here, Catesby.
When did I ever do you any harm?
Varrus and Claudio!
Come to my room later on.
They’re really being spoken, sir, and they’re true.
Well, when Nature makes a person beautiful, can’t Fortune make her fall into a fire, thereby making her ugly after all?
They will, Nerissa, but we’ll be disguised as men.
That’s how things should be—straight and smooth.
What else?
And I had to be away!
Father, could I please ask you to tell these people what happened between me and this young man?
Your darling?
One weakness led to another, to make me hate myself.
But you’re not going to deliver it, are you?
Why, would that have fixed my hair?
Why aren’t the leaves withering now that the sap is all dried up?
Play the kind of music that puts people to sleep.
I have it ready.
Ah, revenge!
Caesar is upset.
I’ll reward you once for your cheerfulness and ten times for your courage.
Today was the day I breathed my first breath.
If I default, he’ll pay you.
Let’s hear it.
With one cut you can be through paying money to Naples.
It’s tragic because Pyramus kills himself.
I know where he is.
I knew a girl who was married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit.
How are things going now?
Advancement to some scaffold, to lose their heads.
I’m ready now to hear what my good cousin the Dauphin has to say—for I hear that the greeting you bear is from him, not the king.
Why don’t you have a seat, your highness?
Oh, is that Kent?
But that’s another story.
Do you dare kill a friend of mine?
From under the earth.
And as for his dreams, I’m surprised he’s so foolish as to trust the fantasies of a restless night.
Now, daughter Katherine?
The things men are allowed to do!
Have you written that down, that they aren’t criminals?
The death of my father, my physical weakness, the loss of all my friends, the threats of this man who’s taken me prisoner—all that would be easy for me to take, if only I could look through my prison windows once a day and see this girl.
You’re wrong, sir, very wrong.
Your son is crazy.
Then it’s no surprise they had a bad influence on him.
I was never disloyal, and I never will be.
Ask him in here.
I would give all my glory for a mug of ale and safety.
At least two hours past.
I have a list of all the important men.
I had planned to celebrate it quietly, but since my lord is once more himself, I will be Cleopatra again.
As for Monsieur Malvolio, let me take care of him.
Is it because of 
Lucillius and Titinius, order the commanders to have the men camp for the night.
Swear by my sword.
What should we do with all these rhyming fools that follow us from post to post?
Let’s not leave him out.
It’s all right, since they left their food behind, and we’re hungry.
Even if you had your eyes, you still might not recognize me.
I’ll reward you for your troubles.
But you didn’t, even though you had every reason.
Lieutenant, I think you know I’m your friend.
If they’re not honest, they shouldn’t look like they are!
Please, don’t mention her.
Friends, Romans, countrymen, give me your attention.
My lord, I have news for you.
The best way to be happy is to be in between.
I beg you to tell me your name so I can use it in my prayers.
Don’t hurt me.
Summertime in Verona has no flower as fine as him.
You need to leave to take care of your own business.
Well, if you could have just an inch of better fortune than me, where would you like the improvement?
Yes, but no doctor can help me.
Short but still tedious?
Listen, I’m going home tomorrow, Sir Toby.
Spoken like a gentleman.
You get trickier and trickier.
Tell me, Othello.
Consider it done, my lord.
Let the rain spray!
Oh, if you are the same Egeon, speak now, and speak to that same Emilia!
And the Prince and Claudio, who accused her, are innocent as well, because they were deceived by Don John.
So take her, shepherd, and God bless you.
It’s pathetic to be Caesar.
Escape and make peace with Caesar.
I swear by the heavens, which have grown pale in sympathy with us, I’m going with you, whatever you say.
Get me some poison tonight, Iago.
In ten days time, if you’re found within twenty miles of the court, you’ll die for it.
You’re my true and honorable wife, as dear to me as the blood that runs through my sad heart.
You’re busted.
It’s someone with a torch!
And when he strikes back at you, he’ll hit you as sure as you’re standing there.
I’ve fought my way through obstacles twenty times more terrifying than you with this weapon.
I beg you, turn away and cry for her.
Sir, a word before you go.
It’d be impossible for you to watch them, even if they were as horny as animals in heat and as stupid as drunks.
Mine wasn’t wearing a bridle.
So let me be brief here.
I’d swear he wouldn’t leave it behind, or even take it off his finger, for all the money in the world.
Fight to the death” is his motto.
I’ll get her, but I won’t keep her long.
I have news for you about the Prince’s punishment.
Isn’t that the reason you told me all this?
I have no gift for the one and no strength for the other, though I have the gift of strength.
Noble Buckingham, your promise is like medicine to my ailing heart.
If you dressed only to stay warm, you wouldn’t need these gorgeous clothes you’re wearing—which don’t keep you warm at all.
Thanks for that.
There was a kind of war in my brain that wouldn’t let me sleep.
The whole world wants her.
Are you going to hide and watch them having sex?
I’m sure you and my husband will be as friendly as you were before.
Shut up, you doddering old wizard!
Therefore, accept my everlasting farewell.
My good friends, I’ll see you tomorrow.
Alas, she has been too long exiled from France, whose crops all lie in heaps, rotting with ripeness.
Sure I can, father.
If I were in England now, like I was once, and I had even a painted picture of this fish, every fool there would give me a piece of silver to look at it.
I believe you are, Regan.
It’s weird.
Give it to me.
Is that the latest we can do it?
I think I see my cousin Tybalt’s ghost.
You’re so infatuated with him that you’re hallucinating.
Here comes Kent.
Yes, and more.
Your Brutus ordered me to give it to you, and I’ll do what he says.
Are you sad about that?
In heaven.
Are you trying to remake me?
You certainly made me believe you did, my lord.
Wasn’t he here?
Why do you go around in circles when you could get to the point?
Don’t worry, I’ll be there.
It’s not lost, but what if it were?
Kill!
What?
I do too, my lord.
Tell him to bring his pen and his inkwell to the jail.
How long has he been possessed like this?
Yes, sir.
Your hand is  Well, I hope so.
But if Antony is alive, healthy, friendly with Caesar, and not Caesar’s prisoner, I’ll shower you with gold and pearls.
His eyes were as green as leeks.
You should know that to me, profit isn’t more important than honor, but the other way around.
The man hasn’t done anything wrong.
Yes, but the mustard is probably too hot.
Did you leave on good terms?
No, you don’t need to worry about us, Lorenzo.
Look how she rubs her hands.
He’s not the most polite man in the world, but, believe me, he’s gentle as a lamb.
He laughed at that and let me go.
You too.
I wish I could keep killing him for nine years straight.
Shall I accompany your Grace?
Signor Antonio?
Are you still set on marrying my brother’s daughter?
She will not.
Then Desdemona and Othello will go back to Venice.
My story does raise that question.
No, it doesn’t mean anything.
The other half goes to the state.
I believe it won’t stop moving and stand upright till Richard wears the wreath of the realm.
Do you see this sweet sight?
I have no desire to go outside, yet something leads me there.
Then hurry up and rush over to Friar Lawrence’s cell.
You’re a villain to say this about me.
Making your loss greater makes the person who caused it worse.
My gracious lord, I should tell you what I saw, but I don’t know how to say it.
It’s my master who’s not getting the reward he deserves, not me.
If she wants to be proud, or “honest,” as she calls it, she can just marry her own pride.
But fortune could not reward me better than to let me die well, without owing my master anything.
What should I do?
I’d risk my soul for that.
I hope you’re right.
Please grant my prayer so my faith doesn’t turn to despair.
He’s a good soldier too, lady.
This is just another one of the hallucinations you always get when you’re afraid.
Have some others search.
Yes sir, thank God.
And yet she cheapens herself by turning her gaze on me, who cut her sweet prince’s life short and made her a widow?
Madam!
First, he sends his regards.
It would be better if they were all on his father’s side, or that there were none at all on his father’s side.
Therefore we’ll have about half a dozen friends to the wedding, and that’s it.
To bed!
Be happy that you’re alive.
Yes, why not, my lord?
Brutus, my lord.
I don’t think about them now.
His father, if I do say so myself, is an honest but very poor man, and, thank God, likely to live a long time.
I’ll stop by before you go to bed, and tell you what I’ve heard.
Well, that one, I think, is young Petruchio.
Where else should his eyes be, if not in his head?
How do you mean, “conspired”?
Well, I’ll commit the sin of double-dealing, and deal you a second coin.
Goodbye, sir.
If they could purge their guilt simply by saying that they were innocent, they’d all be as innocent as God Himself.
Yes, sir, he’s here at the door right now and asks to see you.
That’s true, and with good reason.
And like I am for Rosalind.
I’ll go too and make sure that happens.
If it is, I suggest you don’t eat it.
I didn’t kill Lysander.
So, in God’s name, let’s march.
So, tell people that you’re from Epidamnum–otherwise all your goods will be confiscated.
On one and the same trip Claribel found a husband in Tunis, and Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife where he was shipwrecked; Prospero found his dukedom on a poor island; and all of us found ourselves when we lost control of ourselves.
It did, it did.
What evil and deceitful mirror made me think I could rival Hermia’s starry eyes?
Evil spirit, I want to talk some more.
But I promise you, Kate
I heard Octavius say that Brutus and Cassius have ridden like madmen through the gates of Rome.
So young, my lord, and honest.
No.
Didn’t feel like it?
Is there such a place?
Madam!
Follow”?
Caesar and Lepidus are organizing their military operation.
Your wife Octavia, with her self-effacing eyes and self-righteous assumptions, won’t get any praise from patronizing me.
What do you want me to do with this?
But you’re all wound up about fashion, too.
I’ll use Albany’s power and authority for now to win the war, but afterward one of the sisters—whichever one wants to—can get rid of him.
Where’s Monsieur Cobweb?
Lady!
Then you have to say, “I take you, Rosalind, to be my lawfully wedded wife.” I take you, Rosalind, to be my lawfully wedded wife.
I believe drink did all of this to you last night.
My God, what a great song!
I must join the duke for lunch.
What’s this noise?
The Moor’s killed my mistress!
Light the candles!
I have a lot to tell you about them.
The sun is up and we’re wasting the day!
Royal Egypt, Empress!
The king, sir, has bet that in a dozen rounds between you and Laertes, he won’t beat you by more than three hits.
You always slip out of the argument like this.
It was just like in real life, dark brown with silver whiskers in it.
Come, come, you weak, ungovernable worms!
Make sure everyone knows that.
Is that a lot of      He says his name is Master Fer.
Take your time.
Please tell me seriously what you think of her.
It’s Mercutio’s relative, noble Count Paris!
Why, that’s my dainty Ariel singing now.
You mustn’t hold my earlier outburst against me.
But I never spoke the whole time?
The duke and senators of Venice greet you.
Quiet, everyone!
That?
I am.
Where are you going?
will damage your reputation with them—and under ordinary circumstances it would be unfortunate to have them see you as an ogre.
I speak to you as a plain soldier.
Wouldn’t that have been just as appropriate?
You bastards!
You’re just playing around.
How low we can fall, Horatio.
We don’t intend any harm to you, nor to anyone else.
My lord of Orléans, and my lord high Constable, are you talking about horses and armor?
You were supposed to be proving that there isn’t time for everything.
We’ll have supper in the morning.
But as it stands, I wish I could believe it wasn’t.
But she’s got to die, or she’ll cheat on other men.
But when push comes to shove, they droop like those horses that are all show and slow to a crawl.
I’ll yield my legions and cavalry to Caesar.
And by all means see if you can get the young man to answer it.
Farewell, sir.
The French have retreated, see, and there were great acts of courage.
That’s a good way of putting it.
I spoke with a Frenchman yesterday who said that a Venetian ship loaded with treasure was wrecked in the English Channel.
How’s that?
My father wasn’t a traitor.
Speak one rhyme, and I’ll be satisfied.
I can’t run away.
I’ll ask him for my position back again, and he’ll tell me I’m a drunk.
Everyone who can hear has heard about it.
Lucius, wake up!
Nature would produce its harvests in abundance, to feed my innocent people.
I’ll take you to a place where you can speak freely.
Here we’ll shake hands good-bye.
She’s full of good advice.
I’ll fish for you and get you plenty of firewood.
Are you coming again for ransom?
What do you say to a calf’s foot?
Live, and from now on, say a madman mercifully told you to run away.
She’s beautiful, if my eyes can see.
Really, my lord, why are you so excessively sad?
Romeo.
Then I have to assume you don’t want him to be king.
Probably because my cousin the villain would have killed my husband.
He looked to the side, and pay attention to what he saw then
If he agrees, great.
You absolute villain!
Show us the way, sir.
It is my rival for Bianca.
Stop Harry of England, who is now sweeping through our land with banners drenched in the French blood he spilled at Harfleur.
No, let me say some good things about you while I’m in the mood.
She doesn’t have anything going for her so far.
Oh, this is treachery!
Be happy about it.
Now, Eros.
I’d like to know.
Well, then, what should we do for fun instead?
Look up moonshine, look up moonshine!
Caesar’s better qualities exist in Brutus, and we will crown him.
But quiet.
You seem to think no one outside of your bedroom knows what you wish.
Oh, right, good Catesby.
What Tranio did, he did at my command.
Those uncles that you wish were here were dangerous.
No doubt, my lord.
Come talk to me about this.
Hey, open the door!
There you go.
I don’t have a talent for putting my heart’s feelings into words.
He’s standing ready outside the door.
Eros, my young friend, your captain is now just like that cloud.
What about it?
Yes, just like this.
With his natural luck, he will beat you even against the odds.
After that, nothing can hurt him further—not weapons, poison, rebellion, invasion, or anything else.
Yes, from top to bottom, sir.
I remember, Adam, that’s  Here comes my master, your brother.
I’m very sorry you’re not feeling well.  
It’s new to you.
How are you, my love?—Demetrius and Egeus, come with us.
I’d bet fourteen of my own teeth—but, I’m sorry to say, I only have four teeth—she’s not fourteen.
Come on, another stanza—is that what you call 'em, “stanzas”?
Are you out of your mind and deaf too?
You just fell the height of ten ship masts, straight down.
What sickness did she die of?
She will  A pimp!
It’s almost fairy time.
Your wife and children were savagely slaughtered.
I’ve been poisoned.
If you want things done in the right way, you’ll have to let me read a crazy letter in a crazy voice.
Men act imprudently sometimes, then realize their mistakes when they have time to think about them.
I’m very sorry I was so hard on him.
Good night to you both.
Oh!
Sir, he should have as many as Caesar has.
Oh, blessed, blessed night!
And when you married him and made him the master of your bed, I gave you my word that I would do everything I possibly could for him.
Good morning, Catesby.
I’ll have to do something courageous then, because I hate intrigue.
Two or three of us have seen strange things.
Really?
Go to sleep, and listen to us laughing.
And what about him, Tranio?
Meanwhile, I’d be gratified if you’d live and eat your food.
Gentle Octavia, support the one that supports you.
Here comes the messenger with your niece.
Who do you think you are, keeping me out of my own house?
If this letter’s right, you’ve got a lot to deal with.
Now all my enemies are at my mercy.
Will you come with us?
Let’s say I didn’t kill them.
still fight you and embed your lies back in your hellish heart.—Trumpets, blow!
What do you think of marching to Philippi immediately?
And before I make her normal again—I can cure her by treating her with another plant—I’ll make her give me that little boy as my page.
For God’s sake, sir, you’ve been robbed.
Listen, please, give me the necklace.
She shall, Lucentio.
What blessed work, my king.
My reputation, my reputation!
You’ve served me faithfully.
There’s no other way.
Oh, Bottom, you’ve changed!
I’ll just speak a word or two here in the house and then I’ll go with you.
You swear never to mention what you’ve seen.
My child, my reason for living, wake up, look up, or I’ll die with you!
I can’t make up for everything that I’d like to, so accept such kindness as I can offer.
One, so they can save the money they spent on hairstyling, and two, so that when their hair falls out it doesn’t land in their dinner.
They let God see things they wouldn’t show their husbands.
That’s enough for one lesson.
Ingratitude is always hideous, but an ungrateful child is uglier than a sea monster!
Of what city, may I ask?
He looks humbler than he used to.
Sad, my lady!
Go!
Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio will guarantee it.
Then Dobbin’s tail must be growing backward.
I’ve made my choice.
You don’t have to worry about any of these lords, my lady.
My lord, I informed them as much.
You weren’t good enough for her.
Where are those bastards?
I want to drink your health.
I wouldn’t have given it away for a whole jungle of monkeys.
Let me try
The gods forbid!
God, I’m crazy about her.
I’m going to stand so I can see him pass on the way to the Capitol.
No, my lord, I didn’t see anything.
This treacherous Egyptian has betrayed me.
Can you tell me whether Rosalind, Duke Senior’s daughter, has also been banished?
Oh, you wicked scoundrel!
My lord, you’re wrong to berate her like that.
He has his moods and his ways.
It must be something I did accidentally.
May I speak, Caesar.
Please, one of you go ask that man over there if we can buy some food off him.
As king of this country I like to reward wit when I hear it.
Aren’t the mayor and his fellow citizens coming?
Yes, as safe as her brothers' lives were.
Don’t argue against it.
Follow me, madam.—Throw the blind traitor outside.
Most mighty Caesar, give me some reason, so I won’t be laughed at when I tell them so.
But you’ve raised me as a peasant, hiding from me what I needed to become a gentleman.
Please, let’s not talk about it.
Not offensive at all.
Pindarus!
It seems that the guards who were supposed to be protecting his chamber did it.
She’s so good at sewing, and a wonderful musician.
Until then, I have to remain calm.
Go take care of him.
Lady Olivia will have you executed for not showing up.
Good roaring, Lion!
Cram your good news into my ears.
But don’t expect any more than that.
By the way, if I were to compose an extra speech of twelve to sixteen lines and stick it into the play, you could learn it by heart for tomorrow, right?
Where are the noble Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?
No, I swear on my honor, I haven’t, madam.
Oh, then I see you’ve been with  Who’s Queen Mab?
You’ve connived to steal my daughter’s heart, making her stubborn and harsh instead of obedient (like she should be).—And, my gracious duke, if she won’t agree to marry Demetrius right now, I ask you to let me exercise the right that all fathers have in Athens.
It’s a skull with a scroll in its empty eye socket.
What, you mean my face looks like a crab-apple?
You are Dromio, you are my servant, and you are yourself.
Come inside with me, and I will tell you my plan.
She fainted at the sight of them bleeding.
Tennis balls, my liege.
What, an argument already?
Bottom, you’re Pyramus.—And Flute, you’re Thisbe.
They will steal anything and call it spoils.
The play’s the thing to uncover the conscience of the king.
I have my naked sword out.
But if she can’t love you, sir?
Hello and God bless you, sir.
Shall we go see this fortification, men?
Her curses have made my hair stand on end.
Why, good sir?
Isn’t he a horrible man?
Rogue, you’ve lived too long!
No.
I don’t know what to say.  
Cesario, go visit that cruel Olivia one more time.
Yes, and these.
You would be committing a wicked sin by chiding other people for sinning, because you yourself have been a terrible sinner, as carnal in your appetites as lust itself, and all the swollen pustules of sin that you acquired in your freedom you now want to burst and shoot back into the world at large.
But like an unruly deer, he’s always trespassing past the park borders and straying away from home to feed in new pastures.
Why the nobles were imprisoned, and on what charges, I don’t know, my gracious lord.
The devil’s advice is nicer.
