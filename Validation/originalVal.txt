Thy gown?

I’ll plague him.
Speak this no more.
Husband, let’s follow to see the end of this ado.
My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?
I thank his Grace.
Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve; We in your motion turn, and you may move us.
Here I am.
Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more than any man in all Venice.
Of what, lady?
Portia, art thou gone?
Come, bustle, bustle.
Of Mantua.
You see how easily she may be surprised.
Alas, I rather hate myself For hateful deeds committed by myself.
Stanley, look to your wife.
We must have your doublet and hose plucked over your head and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest.
But one cup.
What are you?
Tomorrow will it please you to be crowned?
As you are old and reverend, should be wise.
Good morrow, neighbor Baptista.
But know that I have tonight wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero’s gentlewoman, by the name of Hero.
Oh, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.
Old fashions please me best.

Come by and by to my chamber.
Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.

Thy love?
One unperfectness shows me another, to make me frankly despise myself.
We shall have a rare letter from him
Why, would that have mended my hair?
Why wither not the leaves that want their sap?
Music such as charmeth sleep!
I have them ready.
O vengeance!
Caesar is touched.
I will reward thee Once for thy sprightly comfort and tenfold For thy good valor.
This day I breathed first.
Antonio shall become bound, well.
Let’s hear it.
One stroke Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest.
For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.
I wot well where he is.
I knew a wench married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit, and so may you, sir.
How goes the world, sir, now?
Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads.
Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure Of our fair cousin Dauphin, for we hear Your greeting is from him, not from the king.
May ’t please your highness sit.
Oh, is this he?
But let that go.
Dar’st thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?
Under the earth.

My father’s loss, the weakness which I feel, The wrack of all my friends, nor this man’s threats, To whom I am subdued, are but light to me, Might I but through my prison once a day Behold this maid.

Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes, I will be brief
No marvel then, though he were ill affected.
I never was nor never will be false.
Go call him hither.
I would give all my fame for a pot of ale, and safety.
At least two glasses.
I have a file Of all the gentry.

For Monsieur Malvolio, let me alone with him.
Is it for him you do envy me so?
Lucillius and Titinius, bid the commanders Prepare to lodge their companies tonight.
Upon my sword.
What should the wars do with these jigging fools?
Let us not leave him out.
No matter, since They have left their viands behind, for we have stomachs.
Nay, indeed if you had your eyes, you might fail of the knowing me.
I will deserve your pains.
You have some cause; they have not.
And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.
Men should be what they seem, Or those that be not, would they might seem none!
Come, talk not of her.
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.
My lord, I have news to tell you.
It is no mean happiness, therefore, to be seated in the mean.
I do beseech you— Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers— What is your name?
Do not torment me.
Verona’s summer hath not such a flower.
I take it your own business calls on you And you embrace th' occasion to depart.
Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than I, where would you choose it?
Ay, past all surgery.

Faith, I’ll home tomorrow, Sir Toby.
Tis noble spoken.
You do advance your cunning more and more.
Tell me, Othello.
I shall do’t, my lord.
Spout, rain!
O, if thou be’st the same Egeon, speak, And speak unto the same Emilia.
So are the Prince and Claudio, who accused her Upon the error that you heard debated.
So take her to thee, shepherd.
Tis paltry to be Caesar.
Fly And make your peace with Caesar.
For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale, Say what thou canst, I’ll go along with thee.
Get me some poison, Iago, this night.
Within these ten days if that thou beest found So near our public court as twenty miles, Thou diest for it.
You are my true and honorable wife, As dear to me as are the ruddy drops That visit my sad heart.
Or wilt thou hunt?
What with a torch!
And on the answer, he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they step on.
That with this little arm and this good sword I have made my way through more impediments Than twenty times your stop.
I prithee, turn aside and weep for her.
Sir, a word ere you go.
It is impossible you should see this, Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys, As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross As ignorance made drunk.
Mine was not bridled.
Brief let me be.
I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth That the world masters.
Hob, nob, is his word.
I’ll have her, but I will not keep her long.
I bring thee tidings of the Prince’s doom.
Was ’t not to this end That thou began’st to twist so fine a story?
For the one, I have neither words nor measure; and for the other, I have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable measure in strength.
A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham, Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.
If only to go warm were gorgeous, Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear’st, Which scarcely keeps thee warm.
Thanks for that.
Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting That would not let me sleep.
All the world desires her.
Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on, Behold her topped?
Do not doubt, Cassio, But I will have my lord and you again As friendly as you were.
Peace, doting wizard, peace.
Therefore our everlasting farewell take.
My good friends, I’ll leave you till night.
Alas, she hath from France too long been chased, And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps, Corrupting in its own fertility.
Certainly, sir, I can.
Were I in England now, as once I was, and had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver.
Regan, I think you are.
Tis strange.
Give me.
Is that the uttermost?
Methinks I see my cousin’s ghost Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body Upon a rapier’s point.
That eye that told you so looked but asquint.
Here comes Kent.
Ay, more.
Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I Will do his bidding.
Why he more than another?
Believe what?
would you create me new?
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
Was he not here?
What need’st thou run so many mile about When thou mayst tell thy tale the nearest way?
I will not fail you.
It is not lost, but what and if it were?
Kill!
What?
So do I, my lord.
Bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the jail.
How long hath this possession held the man?
Even now, sir.
Why, I think so.
Yet if thou say Antony lives, is well, Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him, I’ll set thee in a shower of gold and hail Rich pearls upon thee.
His eyes were green as leeks.
Thou must know, ’Tis not my profit that does lead mine honor; Mine honor, it.
The man is innocent.
Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.
Parted you in good terms?
Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo.
Look, how she rubs her hands.
He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I’ll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb.
So he laughed and let me go.
And you.
I would have him nine years a-killing.
Shall I attend your Grace?
Signor Antonio?
Are you yet determined Today to marry with my brother’s daughter?
She will not.
Why, then Othello and Desdemona return again to Venice.
My tale provokes that question.
Tis neither here nor there.
The other half comes to the general state, Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.
It is a reeling world indeed, my lord, And I believe will never stand upright Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.
Seest thou this sweet sight?
I have no will to wander forth of doors, Yet something leads me forth.
Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence’s cell.
Thou art a villain to impeach me thus.
Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse.
Gracious my lord, I should report that which I say I saw, But know not how to do ’t.
My master, not myself, lacks recompense.
Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.
Yet fortune cannot recompense me better Than to die well, and not my master’s debtor.
What should I do?
I should venture purgatory for ’t.
So I hope.
They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
And a good soldier too, lady.
This is the very painting of your fear.
Some others search.
Ay, sir, I thank God.
And will she yet abase her eyes on me, That cropped the golden prime of this sweet prince And made her widow to a woeful bed?
Madam!
First, he commends him to your noble self.
Better it were they all came by his father, Or by the father there were none at all, For emulation who shall now be nearest Will touch us all too near if God prevent not.
Therefore we’ll have some half a dozen friends, And there an end.
To bed?
The law that threatened death becomes thy friend And turns it to exile—there art thou happy.
Why not, my lord?
Brutus, my lord.
I think not of them.
His father, though I say ’t, is an honest exceeding poor man and, God be thanked, well to live.
I’ll call upon you ere you go to bed And tell you what I know.
Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.
Where should they be set else?
How intend you, “practiced”?
Well, I will be so much a sinner, to be a double-dealer.
Fare you well, sir.
If their purgation did consist in words, They are as innocent as grace itself.
So please you, he is here at the door and importunes access to you.
And I have reason for it.
And I for Rosalind.
I’ll after him, and see the event of this.
If it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it.
I am not guilty of Lysander’s blood.
Then, in God’s name, march.
Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum, Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.
In one voyage Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis; And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife Where he himself was lost; Prospero, his dukedom In a poor isle; and all of us, ourselves When no man was his own.
It did, it did.
What wicked and dissembling glass of mine Made me compare with Hermia’s sphery eyne?
Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.
 the older I grow the better I’ll look.
I heard him say, Brutus and Cassius Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.
So young, my lord, and true.
Why, no.
He would not?
What, is there such a place?
Madam!
Follow”?
Caesar and Lepidus Are in the field.
Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes And still conclusion, shall acquire no honor Demuring upon me.
What is your will that I shall do with this?
But art not thou thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?
Now, then, we’ll use His countenance for the battle, which being done, Let her who would be rid of him devise His speedy taking off.
Where’s Monsieur Cobweb?
Lady!
Then you must say “I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.” I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.
Fore heaven, an excellent song.
I must attend the duke at dinner.
What noise is this?
The Moor hath killed my mistress!
Strike on the tinder, ho!
You must sing  This nothing’s more than matter.
The sun is high, and we outwear the day.
Royal Egypt, Empress!
The king, sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits.
You always end with a jade’s trick.
It was, as I have seen it in his life, A sable silvered.
Come, come, you froward and unable worms!
Make it so known.
He says his name is Master Fer.
Take your time.
I pray thee tell me truly how thou lik’st her.
Mercutio’s kinsman, noble County Paris.
Why, that’s my dainty Ariel.
Thou must not take my former sharpness ill.
But did I never speak of all that time?
The duke and senators of Venice greet you.
Bid every noise be still.
That?
I am so.
Whither goest thou?
But other of your insolent retinue Do hourly carp and quarrel, breaking forth In rank and not-to-be-endurèd riots.
I speak to thee plain soldier.
Had not that been as proper?
What dogs are these!
You do but dally.
To what base uses we may return, Horatio.
There is no harm intended to your person, Nor to no Roman else.
My lord of Orléans, and my Lord High Constable, you talk of horse and armor?
You would all this time have proved there is no time for all things.
We’ll go to supper i' th' morning.
But in respect of that, I would fain think it were not.
Yet she must die, else she’ll betray more men.
But when they should endure the bloody spur, They fall their crests and, like deceitful jades, Sink in the trial.
To Caesar will I render My legions and my horse.
And by all means stir on the youth to an answer.
God rest you merry, sir.
The French is gone off, look you, and there is gallant and most prave passages.
A good epithet!
I reasoned with a Frenchman yesterday, Who told me, in the narrow seas that part The French and English, there miscarried A vessel of our country richly fraught.
How’s that?
My father was no traitor.
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied.
I cannot fly, But, bearlike, I must fight the course.
I will ask him for my place again, he shall tell me I am a drunkard.
Everyone hears that That can distinguish sound.
Lucius, awake.
But nature should bring forth Of its own kind all foison, all abundance, To feed my innocent people.
I will bestow you where you shall have time To speak your bosom freely.
Even here Do we shake hands.
She well instructs me.
I’ll fish for thee and get thee wood enough.
Com’st thou again for ransom?
What say you to a neat’s foot?
Live, and hereafter say A madman’s mercy bid thee run away.
And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true.
What the goodyear, my lord, why are you thus out of measure sad?
Romeo.
Then must I think you would not have it so.
That villain cousin would have killed my husband.
 under an oak tree—whose lower branches were mossy with age and top branches ancient and brittle—he saw a wretched beggar, with overgrown hair and beard, asleep on his back.
If he will take it, so.
Are there no stones in heaven But what serve for the thunder?—Precious villain!
Show ’s the way, sir.
It is the rival of my love.
Bar Harry England, that sweeps through our land With pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur.
Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.
There’s nothing in her yet.
O treachery!
Take it thankfully.
Now, Eros.
I would know that.
What shall be our sport, then?
Find out moonshine, find out moonshine!
Caesar’s better parts Shall be crowned in Brutus!
But, soft!
You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.
O true, good Catesby.
What Tranio did, myself enforced him to.
Those uncles which you want were dangerous.
No doubt, my lord.
Come to me, that of this I may speak more.
Ho, open the door.
Fare you well.
Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave My heart into my mouth.
He is ready at the door.
My good knave Eros, now thy captain is Even such a body.
What o' that?
Good sooth, even thus.
If thou dost play with him at any game, Thou art sure to lose, and of that natural luck He beats thee ’gainst the odds.
Treason has done his worst; nor steel nor poison, Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing Can touch him further.
My lord, from head to foot.
Yonder comes my master, your brother.
I am very sorry that you are not well.
Tis new to thee.
What cheer, my love?— Demetrius and Egeus, go along.
I’ll lay fourteen of my teeth—and yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four—she is not fourteen.
Come, more, another stanzo.
Out o' your wits and hearing too?
Ten masts at each make not the altitude Which thou hast perpendicularly fell.
Upon what sickness?
She will indite him to some supper.
Tis almost fairy time.
Your castle is surprised, your wife and babes Savagely slaughtered.
I am poisoned.
An your ladyship will have it as it ought to be, you must allow  Prithee, read i' thy right wits.
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes, Which after-hours give leisure to repent.
I repent me much That so I harried him.
Give you good night.
Hoo!
He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has, Or needs not us.
O blessèd, blessèd night!
Long since thy husband served me in my wars, And I to thee engaged a prince’s word, When thou didst make him master of thy bed, To do him all the grace and good I could.
Good morrow, Catesby.— You may jest on, but, by the Holy Rood, I do not like these several councils, I.
An ’t be any way, it must be with valor, for policy I hate.
There’s two or three of us have seen strange sights.
Stood the state so?
Go sleep, and hear us.
And what of him, Tranio?
I will desire you to live in the meantime and eat your victuals.
Gentle Octavia, Let your best love draw to that point which seeks Best to preserve it.
Here he comes with your niece.
What art thou that keep’st me out from the house I owe?
If the matter of this paper be certain, you have mighty business in hand.
At this hour Lie at my mercy all mine enemies.
Will you go? 
Say that I slew them not.
Back do I toss these treasons to thy head, With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart—
What do you think Of marching to Philippi presently?
And ere I take this charm from of her sight— As I can take it with another herb— I’ll make her render up her page to me.
Zounds, sir, you’re robbed!
Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain.
She shall, Lucentio.
A blessèd labor, my most sovereign lord.
Reputation, reputation, reputation!
Thou hast served me with much faith.
There is no other way.
O Bottom, thou art changed!
I will but spend a word here in the house And go with you.
Never to speak of this that you have seen.
My child, my only life, Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!— Help, help!
I cannot make you what amends I would; Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
The one, to save the money that he spends in tiring; the other, that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge.
In Venice they do let God see the pranks They dare not show their husbands.
D'elbow.”      “D'elbow,”    “De nick,”  “De nick.”  “De chin.” “De sin.”       
Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend, More hideous when thou show’st thee in a child Than the sea monster.
Of whence, I pray?
His eyes are humbler than they used to be.
Sad, lady!
Go, vanish into air, away!
Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio bound.
It should seem then that Dobbin’s tail grows backward.
I choose her for myself.
You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords.
Well, my good lord, I have informed them so.
This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven Than thou wast worthy her.
Where be these knaves?
I have a health for you.
I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys. 
 If there’s a buck who needs a doe Tell him Rosalind will do.
The gods withhold me!
Beshrew me but I love her heartily.
I go to take my stand To see him pass on to the Capitol.
No, my lord, I saw nothing.
This foul Egyptian hath betrayèd me.
Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke’s daughter, be banished with her father?
O thou pernicious caitiff!
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
He passes some humors and careers.
It is something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose.
Give me leave, Caesar.
I pray you, one of you question yond man, if he for gold will give us any food.
Wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this country.
Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?
And only in that safety died her brothers.
Speak not against it.
Follow me, lady.— Turn out that eyeless villain.
Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause, Lest I be laughed at when I tell them so.
You have trained me like a peasant, obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike qualities.
Prithee, peace.
No offense i' th' world.
What, Pindarus!
Those of his chamber, as it seemed, had done ’t.
So delicate with her needle, an admirable musician.
Till then sit still, my soul.
Go look after him.
My lady will hang thee for thy absence.
Well roared, Lion!
Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears, That long time have been barren.
But do not look for further recompense Than thine own gladness that thou art employed.
You could, for a need, study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and insert in ’t, could you not?
Where is gentle Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?
No, by mine honor, madam.
Oh, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
With cunning hast thou filched my daughter’s heart, Turned her obedience (which is due to me) To stubborn harshness.—And, my gracious duke, Be it so she will not here before your grace Consent to marry with Demetrius, I beg the ancient privilege of Athens.
A carrion death, within whose empty eye There is a written scroll.
What, you mean my face?
Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself.
Go in with me, and I will tell you my drift.
She swoons to see them bleed.
Tennis balls, my liege.
A quarrel, ho, already?
You must play Pyramus.—And Flute, you Thisbe.
They will steal anything and call it purchase.
The play’s the thing Wherein I’ll catch the conscience of the king.
My naked weapon is out.
But if she cannot love you, sir?
God bless you, sir.
This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see ’t?
My hair doth stand an end to hear her curses.
Why, good sir?
Is he not a most profane and liberal counselor?
Rogue, thou hast lived too long.
No.
I am amazed and know not what to say.
Once more, Cesario, Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty.
Ay, and this.
Most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin, For thou thyself hast been a libertine, As sensual as the brutish sting itself, And all th' embossèd sores and headed evils That thou with license of free foot hast caught Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.
But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale And feeds from home.
Why, or for what, the nobles were committed Is all unknown to me, my gracious lord.
The fiend gives the more friendly counsel.
