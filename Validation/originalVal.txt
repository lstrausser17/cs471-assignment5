Possess them not with fear.
If such a one be fit to govern, speak.

You know me by my habit.
Will you walk, sir?—O Desdemona— My lord?
Farewell.
Everything is well.
But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
My lord and you were then at Mantua.— Nay, I do bear a brain.—But, as I said, When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool, To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
Here comes the good Macduff.
What’s here?
Some o’ their plants are ill-rooted already.
Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not?
For taking one’s part that’s out of favor.
There are no faces truer than those that are so washed.
Art of this house?
Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more, Or close the wall up with our English dead!

O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!
Now in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect it is not in the court, it is tedious.
All thy tediousness on me, ah?
O Cassio, whence came this?
A thing for me?
We are blest that Rome is rid of him.
My children too?
I was forbid it.
Come on.
Take it thankfully.
Ready.
Adieu!
She rendered life, Thy name so buried in her.
So, thanks to all at once and to each one, Whom we invite to see us crowned at Scone.
She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.
Villain, I say, knock me at this gate And rap me well, or I’ll knock your knave’s pate.
I will help you to ’t.
Alas, good Kate, I will not burden thee, For knowing thee to be but young and light— Too light for such a swain as you to catch, And yet as heavy as my weight should be.
Not so happy, yet much happier.
Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.
I know it is the moon.
To business that we love we rise betimes And go to ’t with delight.
Are you a married man or a bachelor?
Nothing at all.
Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good life; but in respect that it is a shepherd’s life, it is naught.

I was with Hercules and Cadmus once, When in a wood of Crete they bayed the bear With hounds of Sparta.
And do still, by these pickers and stealers.
How have you known the miseries of your father?
Look behind you, my lord.
Two such opposèd kings encamp them still, In man as well as herbs—grace and rude will.
Tis certain then for Cyprus.
Come, Romeo.
Do but read.
 until I truly fall in love, a woman will never make me act like such a fool.
But I confess, sir, that we were locked out.
Too familiar Is my dear son with such sour company.
Unreal mockery, hence!
Why, then let’s home again.
I can live no longer by thinking.
Then, God grant me too Thou mayst be damnèd for that wicked deed.
But Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man.

Chid I for that at frugal Nature’s frame?
O sweet Portia, Here are a few of the unpleasant’st words That ever blotted paper.
Think on thy sins.
Who is it in the press that calls on me?
How now, how now?
It was.
Your son shall have my daughter with consent.
Cold, cold, my girl, Even like thy chastity.
Tis a blushing, shamefaced spirit that mutinies in a man’s bosom.
Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong.
Thou sayest his sports were hinderd by thy brawls.
Ingrateful fox, ’tis he.
Holy Franciscan Friar!
Use your authority.
No.
Neither my husband nor the slave returned That in such haste I sent to seek his master?
My lord, I hold my life as dear as you do yours, And never in my days, I do protest, Was it so precious to me as ’tis now.
Look, how she rubs her hands.
You take your pennyworths now.
The same.
Do me no foul play, friends.
If I do die before thee, prithee, shroud me In one of these same sheets.

Here therefore for a while I will remain.
Your friends are up and buckle on their armor.
She swoons to see them bleed.
What means this shouting?
Your ear is good.
A little water clears us of this deed.
Here’s to Caesar.
Sir, would she give you so much of her lips As of her tongue she oft bestows on me, You’ll have enough.
I pray thee, overname them.
And doth affection breed it?
Not a drop before.
Would ’t had been done!
Why then, you are in love.
Hamlet, thou art slain.
I saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that
To be once in doubt Is to be resolved.
Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem.

He always loved our sister most, and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off appears too grossly. 
But what of that?
Goneril with a white beard?
On a moderate pace I have since arrived but hither.
Antonio, O my dear Antonio!
Decius Brutus loves thee not.
Tis three o'clock, and, Romans, yet ere night We shall try fortune in a second fight.
Be not afraid.
I would not spare my brother in this case If he should scorn me so apparently.
Our severed navy too Have knit again, and fleet, threat’ning most sealike.
I will praise any man that will praise me, though it cannot be denied what I have done by land.

They are entirely welcome.
Flat burglary as ever was committed.
It did, it did.

See better, Lear, and let me still remain The true blank of thine eye.
Welcome, my lord.
The flat transgression of a schoolboy who, being overjoyed with finding a birds' nest, shows it his companion, and he steals it.
I shall be reconciled to him again.

My suit to her Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona Procure me some access.
Fear you not my part of the dialogue.

Romeo.
I’ll not endure it.
Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee.
My servant, sir!
That’s not the tune.
Please it your Grace lead on?
She’s gone forever.
I must be laughed at If or for nothing or a little, I Should say myself offended, and with you Chiefly i’ th’ world; more laughed at, that I should Once name you derogately, when to sound your name It not concerned me.
One minded like the weather, most unquietly.
And Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou see Lorenzo, who is thy new master’s guest.
Oh, my soul’s joy!
Play the men.
What, mistress!
Ay, my lord.
Here is a place reserved, sir.
This morning, like the spirit of a youth That means to be of note, begins betimes.
I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard, Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke, Fulfill your pleasure.
The prayers of holy saints and wrongèd souls, Like high-reared bulwarks, stand before our faces.
Do so.
If this be not that you look for, I have no more to say, But bid Bianca farewell forever and a day.
The red plague rid you For learning me your language!
Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay.
Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself, for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve.
So quick bright things come to confusion.
Yet I persuade myself to speak the truth Shall nothing wrong him.
These deeds must not be thought After these ways.
That courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.
Nor know I aught But that he’s well and will be shortly here.
I did send To you for gold to pay my legions, Which you denied me.
And did you leave him in this contemplation?
Madam, I wish it may.
Where’s the Master?
Why are you silent?
Tell him, so please him come unto this place, He shall be satisfied and, by my honor, Depart untouched.

Ride you this afternoon?
What are his words?
Good Enobarbus!
How now, friend Eros!
But here’s a parchment with the seal of Caesar.
Mass, and my elbow itched, I thought there would a scab follow.

Good morrow to you both.
I have used thee, Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee In mine own cell till thou didst seek to violate The honor of my child.
Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night.
I will confess to you that I love him.
What say you?
Think, when we talk of horses, that you see them Printing their proud hoofs i' th' receiving earth, For ’tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings, Carry them here and there, jumping o'er times,
He was not born to shame.
I have no ambition To see a goodlier man.
This weaves itself perforce into my business.
But now I see our lances are but straws, Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare, That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
If you shall cleave to my consent, when ’tis, It shall make honor for you.
Well met here.
Wherefore speaks he this To her he hates?
An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.
Tis cowardly and womanish.
Seek thine own ease.
Show me briefly how.
My lord, the roinish clown, at whom so oft Your Grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.
This night methinks is but the daylight sick.
Why, to keep one’s eyes of either side ’s nose, that what a man cannot smell out, he may spy into.
Take a trumpet, herald.
So let him land, And solemnly see him set on to London.
Upon mine honor, sir, I heard a humming, And that a strange one too, which did awake me.
I was born to speak all mirth and no  matter.
She shall be buried with her face upwards.
Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father’s house.
I’ll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria.
Look, look.
Madam.
It is even so.
Past all expressing.
I would eat his heart in the marketplace.
The reason that I gather he is mad, Besides this present instance of his rage, Is a mad tale he told today at dinner Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.
Thou wouldst make a good fool.
The quality of mercy is not strained.
Good night.
O heavy day!
But, sir, here comes your boy.
Tis double wrong to truant with your bed And let her read it in thy looks at board.
She said so.
Sir, I say to you we are none.
 he is in love.
No, not a whit.
If not to answer, you might haply think Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty, Which fondly you would here impose on me.
Believe me, King of Shadows, I mistook.
I can say little more than I have studied, and that question’s out of my part.
What’s the matter?
Claudio!
Casca, by your voice.
We will haste us.
Come you, sir.
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city?
I’ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.
We have beat him to his camp.
Promise me life, and I’ll confess the truth.
Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field You do me mischief.
What mean’st thou, that thou help’st me not?
As thou got’st Milan, I’ll come by Naples.
Go thy ways to a nunnery.
It well appears.
No, make it two more.
Lorenzo, and thy love.
Tom will throw his head at them.—Avaunt, you curs!
Mistress!
 “When the man dies, let the inheritance descend unto the daughter.” Gracious lord, claim what is yours.
With cunning hast thou filched my daughter’s heart, Turned her obedience (which is due to me) To stubborn harshness.—And, my gracious duke, Be it so she will not here before your grace Consent to marry with Demetrius, I beg the ancient privilege of Athens.
I have them ready.
Good Grumio, fetch it me.
Let’s see these pockets.
To who?
She shall, Lucentio.
Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.
Twere good you do so much for charity.
Fortune, that arrant whore,  Ne'er turns the key to th' poor.
Our friends all stay for you.
Where remains he?
You see an ass head of your own, do you?
Well, good night.
Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar, I have not slept.
What, will you have them weep our horses' blood?
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late, It may be thought we held him carelessly, Being our kinsman, if we revel much.
Well, you temporize with the hours.
Where art thou now?
Welcome.
And let him ply his music.
There the grown serpent lies.
We first address towards you, who with this king Hath rivaled for our daughter.
Wine loved I deeply, dice dearly, and in woman outparamoured the Turk.
That a maiden’s heart hath burned?
What’s to say?
Thus hath the candle singed the moth.
Here comes Sir Oliver.—Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met.
What is Pyramus?
But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial, wherein, if I be foiled, there is but one shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one dead that was willing to be so.
You, mistress, all this coil is long of you.
Have you not hurt your head?
Here he comes.
If Caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done no less.
God bless you, sir.
Tis not the first time you were overshot.
Therefore, as I am bound, Receive it from me.
Methought I heard a voice cry, “Sleep no more!
Ill luck, ill luck?
I am not of your element.
My lord, what is your will?
This bud of love, by summer’s ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us, sir.
The dearest ring in Venice will I give you, And find it out by proclamation.
What, still in tears, Evermore showering?
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars But in ourselves, that we are underlings.
Romeo, he cries aloud, “Hold, friends!
Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain, As in revenge, have sucked up from the sea Contagious fogs, which falling in the land Have every pelting river made so proud That they have overborne their continents.
They must be bound and laid in some dark room.
Not that we love words better, as you do.
Neighbors and friends, though bride and bridegroom wants For to supply the places at the table, You know there wants no junkets at the feast.
There’s matter in ’t indeed, if he be angry.
Taste your legs, sir.
The selfsame name, but one of better nature.
Come between us, good Benvolio.
Sir?
I noted her not, but I looked on her.
Say you have wronged her, sir.
He, sir.
Oh, heaven forgive me!
Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords In our own proper entrails.
Thy lover,      Artemidorus” Here will I stand till Caesar pass along, And as a suitor will I give him this.
If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.
Then take him up and manage well the jest.
This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.
For both our sakes, I would that word were true.
Ha, Portia?
Why Romeo, art thou mad?
At first the infant, Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms.
Oh, there has been much throwing about of brains.
Prithee, be cheerful.
She is banished.
Tis heavy night, These may be counterfeits.
What is here?
Now, then, we’ll use His countenance for the battle, which being done, Let her who would be rid of him devise His speedy taking off.
How now, my noble friend?
I would I were senseless, sir, that I might not feel your blows.
But jealous souls will not be answered so.
Seyton!
I am tame, sir.
Had I but died an hour before this chance, I had lived a blessèd time, for from this instant There’s nothing serious in mortality.
But soft, I pray you.
I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.
Arise, you shall not kneel.
She that was ever fair and never proud, Had tongue at will and yet was never loud, Never lacked gold and yet went never gay, Fled from her wish and yet said “Now I may,” She that being angered, her revenge being nigh, Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly, She that in wisdom never was so frail To change the cod’s head for the salmon’s tail, She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind, See suitors following and not look behind, She was a wight, if ever such wights were— To do what?
This is some minx’s token, and I must take out the work?
Bid farewell to your sisters.
And you.
I will employ thee back again; I find thee Most fit for business.
Monster, I will kill this man.
And say besides that in Aleppo once, Where a malignant and a turbaned Turk Beat a Venetian and traduced the state, I took by the throat the circumcisèd dog, And smote him, thus.
Oh, villainous!
Will you come presently?
I was too young that time to value her, But now I know her.
I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.
Come, go we to the king.
Come, come away.
Even he, madam.
Truly, an obedient lady.
Dromio—thou, Dromio—thou snail, thou slug, thou sot.
Remember thee!
By and by.
Here.
Therefore I promise ye I fear you.
For I tell you, father, I am as peremptory as she proud-minded; And where two raging fires meet together, They do consume the thing that feeds their fury.
Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.
I see that thou art poor.
News, my good lord, from Rome.
When you sued staying, Then was the time for words.
Is it your own inclining?
Do not doubt, Cassio, But I will have my lord and you again As friendly as you were.
Who intercepts my expedition?
Life, living, all is Death’s.
What effects, my lord?
You have done well, That men must lay their murders on your neck.
Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
I’ll none of it.
Strives in his little world of man to outscorn The to-and-fro–conflicting wind and rain.
And this, Metellus Cimber.
Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.— Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar!
Let me but meet you ladies one hour hence, And I’ll salute your Grace of York as mother And reverend looker-on, of two fair queens.
If it be not for some purpose of import, Give ’t me again.
Tis hard; almost impossible.
Never, my lord.
She bids you come to her.
O, farewell, honest soldier.
Such news, my lord, as grieves me to report.
Upon my power I may dismiss this court, Unless Bellario, a learnèd doctor, Whom I have sent for to determine this, Come here today.
If a man’s brains were in ’s heels, were ’t not in danger of kibes?
Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner he would not.
Out of my sight!
My duty cannot suffer To obey in all your daughters' hard commands.
Fare you well. 
If every one knows us, and we know none, 'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack, and be gone.
Fare you well, sir.
Sooth, but you must.
O sir, you are too sure an augurer.
I pray thee, hear me speak.
Come, you deceive yourself.
Tis fittest.
That lord that counseled thee To give away thy land, Come place him here by me.
Most veritable, therefore look to ’t well.
Call the messenger.
You have not called me so, nor have you cause.
Of this my letters Before did satisfy you.
Why, then, some be of laughing, as, ah, ha, he!
The Duke’s in council and your noble self, I am sure, is sent for.
Right, I mean you.
I have this present evening from my sister Been well informed of them—and with such cautions That if they come to sojourn at my house I’ll not be there.
How goes the world with thee?
And from henceforth When you are over-earnest with your Brutus, He’ll think your mother chides and leave you so.
I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.
But who comes here?
No, no.
Five-and-twenty, sir.
But fare you well.
If she be false, heaven mocked itself.
Give the word, ho, and stand.
Adieu, good Queen.
Sit i' th' middle.
Well then, sustain me.
Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender Of my child’s love.
Not a word.
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
Why dost thou ask?
As long as heaven and nature lengthens it.
Now, my lord.
If it be you that stir these daughters' hearts Against their father, fool me not so much To bear it tamely.
Thou, it seems, that calls for company to countenance her.
Oh, misery!
Thou dost thy office fairly.
Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here Shalt with him hence.
Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows, Swears he will shoot no more, but play with sparrows And be a boy right out.
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio.
Sir, I must have that diamond from you.
Is that true?
But thine doth fry.
Pray, what do you think is his name?
How shall I know thee again?
Then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands.
And twenty of these puny lies I’ll tell, That men shall swear I have discontinued school Above a twelvemonth.
I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord.
This must crave— An if this be at all—a most strange story.
Well, we were born to die.
Write them together, yours is as fair a name.
My cousin’s a fool, and thou art another.
Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?
Avaunt!
It were good that Benedick knew of it by some other, if she will not discover it.
Stephano is my name, and I bring word My mistress will before the break of day Be here at Belmont.
I shifted him away And laid good ’scuses upon your ecstasy,
First, rehearse your song by rote, To each word a warbling note.
Is ’t possible?
Caesar, I go.
Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone.
Support him by the arm.
The lunatic, the lover, and the poet Are of imagination all compact.
Not with salt tears.
Front to front Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself.
Our posts shall be swift and intelligent betwixt us.—Farewell, dear sister.
I took him sleeping—that is finished too— And the Athenian woman by his side, That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed.
May be she doth but counterfeit.
What said my man, when my betossèd soul Did not attend him as we rode?
They are then excused, my lord, when they see not what they do.
Not very well, but I have met him oft, And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds That the old carlot once was master of.
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty, And, till she stoop, she must not be full-gorged, For then she never looks upon her lure.
Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.
No marvel then, though he were ill affected.
Give me some ink and paper.
But I’ll catch thine eyes, Though they had wings.
 King Lewis the Tenth, who was sole heir to the usurper Capet, could not rest easy as king until he was assured that Queen Isabel, his grandmother, was a direct descendent of the Lady Ermengare, daughter of the aforementioned Charles duke of Lorraine, by which marriage the line of Charles the Great was reunited with the throne of France.
A substitute shines brightly as a king Until a king be by, and then his state Empties itself, as doth an inland brook Into the main of waters.
How fares my gracious sir?
Let him take thee And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians!
My good lord.
There, drink that for me.
Oh, that I served that lady And might not be delivered to the world, Till I had made mine own occasion mellow, What my estate is.
We’ll burn his body in the holy place, And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.
They call it Agincourt.
Ay, two hours together.
How, in stripping it, You more invest it!
If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should be glad of his approach.
Le Roy?
And bid her come hither.
Know you any, count?
Wouldst thou aught with me?
Bring a corollary, Rather than want a spirit.
I’ll to the friar to know his remedy.
This I wonder at, That he, unknown to me, should be in debt.
Thou hast amazed me.
Why, what you will.
It is my day, my life.
I am not bid for love.
Not till God make men of some other metal than earth.
Farewell, and if my fortune be not crost, I have a father, you a daughter, lost.
Alas, poor country!
Do not answer me.
Ha, what sayest thou?
Cunning.
Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man, Of these known evils but to give me leave By circumstance to curse thy cursèd self.
But who is with him?
Good sir—
Yea,” quoth he, “Dost thou fall upon thy face?
Good night, good Captain Blunt.
He comes, my lord.
My soul is full of sorrow.
Farewell, farewell.
A rarer spirit never Did steer humanity, but you gods will give us Some faults to make us men.
Go, fetch me something
Look, here comes a walking fire.
Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours.
Will you go to them?
He misses not much.
Thou look’st cheerly, and I’ll be with thee quickly.
How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?
I am afeard, Being in night, all this is but a dream, Too flattering sweet to be substantial.
They stand and would have parley.
Open your gates.
Give the word through.
Go to, you’re a dry fool.
Shall we see this wrestling, cousin? 
No, not till Thursday.
We have scorched the snake, not killed it.
She’s not fourteen.
Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup.
Why, for that too.
Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.
No words can that woe sound.
But all the charms of love, Salt Cleopatra, soften thy wanned lip!
He was not three leagues off when I left him.
A husband?
I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited.
Her name is Margery, indeed.
I am no traitor.
Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.
John Duke of Norfolk, Walter, Lord Ferrers, Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.
No, pray thee.
Now, for my life, she’s wandering to the Tower, On pure heart’s love, to greet the tender prince.— Daughter, well met.
Done.
Since thou dost give me pains, Let me remember thee what thou hast promised, Which is not yet performed me.
Her length of sickness, with what else more serious Importeth thee to know, this bears.
It is worth the pains.
Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.
Only be patient till we have appeased The multitude, beside themselves with fear, And then we will deliver you the cause, Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him, Have thus proceeded.
But since he is better we have therefore odds.
Jailer, look to him.
Filth, thou liest!
Stay with us.
Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty—I pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house, for I never saw her.
Believe me for mine honor, and have respect to mine honor that you may believe.
How does my bounteous sister?
She hath prevented me.
Thus I do escape the sorrow Of Antony’s death.
Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.
Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
Hail.
Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter?
Come, let us go.
That which is now a horse, even with a thought The rack dislimns and makes it indistinct As water is in water.
That’s more to me than my wetting.
Yonder comes my master, your brother.

Take in your love, and then let me alone.
If you do love me you will find me out.— Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.
I set him there, sir, but his own disorders Deserved much less advancement.
Fare you well.
Thou art a soldier only.
How now, masters?
Nay, that’s not your way.
Thy half o' th' kingdom hast thou not forgot, Wherein I thee endowed.

A fine woman!
Be assured you may.
Enough, Captain.

The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you.
There.
Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words, and words are grown so false, I am loath to prove reason with them.
Shall I strike now?
That which ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in.
I will be faithful.
Here comes the lady.
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
He hath honored me of late, and I have bought Golden opinions from all sorts of people, Which would be worn now in their newest gloss, Not cast aside so soon.
Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.
Wilt thou not, Jule?” It stinted and said “ay.” And stint thou too, I pray thee, Nurse, say I.
Faith, niece, you tax Signor Benedick too much, but he’ll be meet with you, I doubt it not.
There was a pretty redness in his lip, A little riper and more lusty red Than that mixed in his cheek
I dare abide no longer.
When think you that the sword goes up again?
The gods reward your kindness!
Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way to Master Jew’s?
But ’tis gone.
Bless thy five wits.
No cause, no cause.
If this were played upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an improbable fiction.
A right good markman!
Had you such leisure in the time of death To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?
Spakest thou of Juliet?
I beseech you, follow straight.
His speech was like a tangled chain.
What, shall I groan and tell thee?
Why did you so?
Into a thousand parts divide one man, And make imaginary puissance.
Put off your maiden blushes, avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress, take me by the hand, and say “Harry of England, I am thine,” which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal, but I will tell 
Now I must To the young man send humble treaties, dodge And palter in the shifts of lowness, who With half the bulk o’ th’ world played as I pleased, Making and marring fortunes.
No?
Why, this is not a boon, 'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves, Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm, Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit To your own person.
Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?
You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting, With most admired disorder.
If you come slack of former services, You shall do well.
Of a certain knight that swore by his honor they were good pancakes, and swore by his honor the mustard was naught.
So turns she every man the wrong side out And never gives to truth and virtue that Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.
I say, remember.
What is ’t you seek?
God keep your Worship!
This is not the way To win your daughter.
How lush and lusty the grass looks!
I dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men’s minds.
Tis well I am found by you.
My lord, you know I love you.
Oh, she will sing the savageness out of a bear!
How now!
No more, I pray thee.
M”—Malvolio.
You shall, my lord.
Be gentle to her.
What’s he?
Nor I.
You have little cause to say so.
Friar!
Ely with Richmond troubles me more near Than Buckingham and his rash-levied strength.
William, sir.
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep, My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.
Speak.
I heard thee say even now thou lik’st not that When Cassio left my wife.
My lady charged my duty in this business.
The Emperor calls Canidius.
Why, thy godhead laid apart, Warr’st thou with a woman’s heart?
Lesser than Macbeth and greater.
And I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took two cods and, giving her them again, said with weeping tears, “Wear these for my sake.” We that are true lovers run into strange capers.
This night I hold an old accustomed feast, Whereto I have invited many a guest Such as I love.
I am very ill at ease, Unfit for mine own purposes.
You have astonished him.
You’ve said, sir.
Come the next sabbath, and I will content you.
Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate Call all in all sufficient?
Tush, tush, man, never fleer and jest at me.
She speaks poniards, and every word stabs.
I cannot hear of any that did see her.
Oh, widow Dido?
Call you me “fair”?
He cannot be heard of.
If the English had any apprehension, they would run away.
Ay, my lord.
Never believe it.
I pray you, fail me not.
My honored lord!
Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode.
O gull!
O noble sir!
peace, this piece of toasted cheese will do ’t.
Go with me, Silvius.
I shall return before your Lordship thence.
Just as high as my heart.
Twill be a good way, and tomorrow the wrestling is.
Upon the corner of the moon There hangs a vap'rous drop profound.
Then, tell me, Who’s the next heir of Naples?
Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears, That long time have been barren.
In such a night as this!
Why grow the branches when the root is gone?
The music, ho!
By my soul I swear There is no power in the tongue of man To alter me.
This Caesar was a tyrant.
Think upon Vaughan, and with guilty fear Let fall thy lance.

I am sorry I beat thee.
This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad, And much different from the man he was.
Here at the door.
Oh yes, my lord.
I would you were as I would have you be!
O God of battles, steel my soldiers' hearts.
I am not gamesome.
I do suspect I have done some offense That seems disgracious in the city’s eye, And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.
What art thou that dost grumble there i' th' straw?
Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old gentleman’s saying.
What thinkest thou of his opinion?
This is the air-drawn dagger which you said Led you to Duncan.

Let me report to him Your sweet dependency, and you shall find A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness Where he for grace is kneeled to.
Tis good we do so.
Put up thy sword, Or manage it to part these men with me.
Of what, lady?
Speak.
I did so, and take heed on ’t, Make it a darling like your precious eye.
If so, my eyes are oftener washed than hers.
That do I long to hear.
Alack, our terrene moon is now eclipsed, And it portends alone the fall of Antony.
And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you, Immediately to us.
Ha, ha, are you honest?
I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it.
Oh, the cry did knock Against my very heart!
There let him sink, and be the seas on him!
Father, in.
But, hark thee, Charmian.
The Lord Mayor knocks.
One cried, “God bless us!” and “Amen” the other, As they had seen me with these hangman’s hands.
Come, wait upon him.
Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
Not a whit.
I swear by that which I will lose for thee To prove him false that says I love thee not.
So doth the greater glory dim the less.
Hold, take my sword.
A sick man in sadness makes his will, A word ill urged to one that is so ill.
Romeo!
But you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity.
Gracious my lord, I should report that which I say I saw, But know not how to do ’t.
Is it two days ago since I tripped up thy heels and beat thee before the king?
The news is true, my lord.
Not he that himself is not so, which is Mark Antony.
Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!
What, shall I be appointed hours as though, belike, I knew not what to take and what to leave, ha?
Mistress, you must come away to your father.
Set we our squadrons on yond side o’ th’ hill, In eye of Caesar’s battle, from which place We may the number of the ships behold And so proceed accordingly.
And so have I addressed me.
Abide within.
Tis so.
I will be mild and gentle in my words.
Are you native of this place?
Last thing he did, dear Queen, He kissed—the last of many doubled kisses— This orient pearl.
Advise the duke where you are going, to a most festinate preparation.
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand, Unbated and envenomed.
Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure Of our fair cousin Dauphin, for we hear Your greeting is from him, not from the king.
And so am I for Rosalind.
I am sure he had more hair of his tail than I have of my face when I last saw him.
Please, let me stay.
Why have you stol’n upon us thus?
With any strong or vehement importunity.
Then I’ll be brief.
They shall, Nerissa, but in such a habit That they shall think we are accomplishèd With that we lack.
Should I lie, madam?
And begged he pardon?
I fight against thee?
I know ’t—my sister’s.
The Prince’s fool!
When it is paid, bring your true friend along.
Ready.
What is my name?
Here, here!
And you, good sir.
So do I, my lord.
If you’ll patch a quarrel, As matter whole you have to make it with, It must not be with this.
I will deal in poison with thee, or in bastinado, or in steel.
Humbly I thank your grace.
They are afoot.
This cannot anger him.
I cannot tell.
No, nor more fearful.
Your cause of sorrow Must not be measured by his worth, for then It hath no end.
And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn, Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.
They mean to warn us at Philippi here, Answering before we do demand of them.
That high All-seer which I dallied with Hath turned my feignèd prayer on my head And given in earnest what I begged in jest.
How does the queen?
She is indeed perfection.
A monster, a very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian footboy or a gentleman’s lackey.
We must not now displease him.
Help me hence, ho!
You beastly knave, know you no reverence?
I know this is a joyful trouble to you, But yet ’tis one.
Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts On his behalf.
He is very busy about it.
You may light on a husband that hath no beard.
Here, sweet lord, at your service.
Tis good.
He is descried.
One woe doth tread upon another’s heel, So fast they follow.—Your sister’s drowned, Laertes.
My mistress, dearest, and I thus humble ever.
Set your heart at rest.
It is as easy as lying.
Go, one of you, find out the forester.
He hath the falling sickness.
Thou canst tell why one’s nose stands i' th' middle on ’s face? 
With drinking healths to my niece.
Not so hot.
How durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser And serve it thus to me that love it not?
Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona, That which so often you did bid me steal.
Upon the right hand I.
Let me be your servant.
What, thou speak’st drowsily?
Prithee, if thou lovest me, tell me.
O Banquo, Banquo, Our royal master’s murdered!
Aha!
Peace!
Your cake there is warm within; you stand here in the cold.
What, thou meanest an officer?
He lies to th' heart.
Oh, in this love, you love your child so ill That you run mad, seeing that she is well.
But, my good lord, your Graces' words shall serve As well as I had seen and heard him speak; And do not doubt, right noble princes both, But I’ll acquaint our duteous citizens With all your just proceedings in this case.
I’ll halt after.
Then Edgar was abused.
No, by no means.
Ay, sir.
 stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave.
And am I then revenged
Look what I have.
Soon may I hear and see him.
They never meet but there’s a skirmish of wit between them.
But how long shall that title “ever” last?
And I must be from thence!
If he awake, From toe to crown he’ll fill our skins with pinches, Make us strange stuff.
No marvel though she pause; They can be meek that have no other cause.
Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?
Sport?
He has brave utensils—for so he calls them— Which when he has a house, he’ll deck withal.
Ay.
Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you.
O most courageous day!
A very weak monster.
Ah, that’s a foul fault.
How beauteous mankind is!
What do you think of me?
Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season.
The ship was under sail.
But do not go with it.
I am aweary of this moon.
He did bewray his practice, and received This hurt you see striving to apprehend him.
His answer was, the people were not used To be spoke to but by the recorder.
So every bondman in his own hand bears The power to cancel his captivity.
Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.
Why, very well then.
A piece of ice.
It’s the wind.
A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse!
I am Grumio’s pledge.
Bring him away.
Let us seek out some desolate shade and there Weep our sad bosoms empty.
Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.
Tis monstrous.
For what offence?
Justice, most sacred duke, against the Abbess.
I think it doth.
Hail.
For a fish without a fin, there’s a fowl without a feather.—   Go, get thee gone.
I will be near to second your attempt, and he shall fall between us.
In the meantime, Let me be thought too busy in my fears— As worthy cause I have to fear I am— And hold her free, I do beseech your honor.
Shall we call in th' ambassador, my liege?
Pray, then, foresee me one.
Madam, O good Empress!
He hath refused it in the open court.
Tongue, not a word.
A madness most discreet, A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
Go off.
I am feared in field and town.
In time we hate that which we often fear.
Soft, here follows prose.
When are you married, madam?
The Queen approaches.
I never got him.— Hark, the duke’s trumpets.
I shall obey you.
Fare thee well.
You are not wood, you are not stones, but men.
I’ll to my book, For yet ere supper-time must I perform Much business appertaining.
For as thou urgest justice, be assured Thou shalt have justice more than thou desirest.
Or I have no observance.
Thou liest, thou thread, thou thimble, Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!
Through the house give glimmering light, By the dead and drowsy fire.
I your servant.
The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder, Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day More than the wildcat.
Hail.
You mar our labor.
Both, both, my girl.
Look, here comes Helena.
Villain, not for thy life!
I have noted it well.
Rosalind of a better leer than you.
How many then should cover that stand bare!
I’ll board him presently.
If she do, he’ll smile and take ’t for a great favor.
No doubt the murd'rous knife was dull and blunt Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart, To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
At last I left them I' th' filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell, There dancing up to th' chins, that the foul lake O'erstunk their feet.
I’ll fetch some flax and whites of eggs To apply to his bleeding face.
Brutus, bait not me.
Nay, pray you throw none away.
Where is Antony?
May not one speak?
Why I should fear I know not, Since guiltiness I know not.
I hear him.
What, is he angry?
Can heaven be so envious?
I can no more.
I pray you, sir, what is he?
Confusion now hath made his masterpiece.
I thank you, sir.
Yet I love thee too.
How!
To which we all appeal.
World, world, O world!
I’ll leave you.
Signior Brabantio, ho!
Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.
I never gave him cause.
There’s other business for thee.
Stay the friar too.
Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embarked?
Be better at thy leisure.
Doth this news hold of good King Edward’s death?
Yet thou didst kill my children.
Alas, sir, it is worse for me than so, For I have bills for money by exchange From Florence, and must here deliver them.
And here will rest me.
I will fall prostrate at his feet And never rise until my tears and prayers Have won his grace to come in person hither And take perforce my husband from the Abbess.
Look where it comes again!
Let it go all.
You would be satisfied?
If you love her then, tomorrow wed her.
What will you give us?
A holy day shall this be kept hereafter.
Why, is it not news to hear of Petruchio’s coming?
Let me speak a little.
How?
She’s cold.
Justice, find the girl!
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.
My wits faints.
He lays it on.
Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
My Lord— Ay, what’s o'clock?
Do you not know me, Father?
Sola!
I may command where I adore, But silence, like a Lucrece knife, With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore; M.O.A.I.
Why, what is Tybalt?
O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me, Even daughter, welcome in no less degree.
Here, here comes Master Signior Leonato, and the Sexton too.
But as yet, I swear, I cannot truly say how I came here.
This may prove food to my displeasure.
Fly, masters!
I will proclaim my name about the field.
This pernicious slave, Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer, And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
Nay, I’ll ne'er believe a madman till I see his brains.
He did not call, he’s busy in the paper.
I shall be constrained in ’t to call thee knave, knight. 
The lady of the Strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe.
What, shall I find you here?
My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.
Marry, sir, they have committed false report; moreover, they have spoken untruths; secondarily, they are slanders; sixth and lastly, they have belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust things; and, to conclude, they are lying knaves.
Soft, soft!
All the pictures fairest lined Are but black to Rosalind.
O Goneril, You are not worth the dust which the rude wind Blows in your face.
Why not, my lord?
Ha!
Now, good sir, what are you?
Give me your arm.
Hear the ambassadors.
Ay, by my life, And never did desire to see thee more.
Whip me such honest knaves.
Some say the lark makes sweet division.
Lovers, to bed.
Where’s my fool, ho?
O noble Emperor, do not fight by sea!
How heavy weighs my lord!
Here is my bed.
Found you no displeasure in him by word or countenance?
He would not have spoke such a word.
Go, bind this man, for he is frantic too.
But we will draw the curtain and show you the picture.
Why ask you?
I’ll get me to a place more void, and there Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.
What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel, And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
Oh, he hath murdered his master!
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds; They smack of honor both.
There’s none else by.
What was the second noise for?
Dromio, nor thou?
Only foul words, and thereupon I will kiss thee.
Not now.
It sorts well with your fierceness.
Let us score their backs And snatch ’em up, as we take hares, behind!
I will not shame myself to give you this.
Why, what canst thou tell, my boy?
Oh, If you but knew how you the purpose cherish Whiles thus you mock it!
These both put off, a poor petitioner, A care-crazed mother to a many sons, A beauty-waning and distressèd widow, Even in the afternoon of her best days, Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye, Seduced the pitch and height of his degree To base declension and loathed bigamy.
Are there balance here to weigh The flesh?
O, help him, you sweet heavens!
Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise And dangerous success of bloody wars As I intend more good to you and yours Than ever you or yours were by me harmed!
Wake Duncan with thy knocking.
Beguiled, divorcèd, wrongèd, spited, slain!
But, till the king come forth, and not till then, Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.
I would lose all—ay, sacrifice them all Here to this devil—to deliver you.
And how besides thyself?
Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.
Nor anyone.
I would not follow him then.
So.   
Wake her not.
And is ’t not to be damned To let this canker of our nature come In further evil?
What, worse and worse?— With leave, Bassanio, I am half yourself, And I must freely have the half of anything That this same paper brings you.
I am to blame.
The good years shall devour them, flesh and fell, Ere they shall make us weep.
I muse why she’s at liberty.
Speak yet again.
I dare damnation.
Who’s within?
I cannot think it.
There lock yourself and send him word you are dead.
What is the matter there?
What, i' th' storm, i' th' night?
My talk to thee must be how Benedick Is sick in love with Beatrice.
What traitor hears me and says not “Amen?” England hath long been mad and scarred herself.
Stanley, look to your wife.
More matter for a May morning.
But if you fail, without more speech, my lord, You must be gone from hence immediately.
Tis true indeed, so your daughter says.
An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.    
Hath she forsook so many noble matches, Her father and her country, and her friends, To be called “whore”?
How think you of it?
Shame of ladies, sisters!
Or if thou hast not sat as I do now, Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress’s praise, Thou hast not loved.
Here I am Antony, Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.
But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
Is it new and old too?
This contents.
Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.
I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
All this amazement can I qualify When after that the holy rites are ended I’ll tell you largely of fair Hero’s death.
Tell me what more thou know’st.
We say the king Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous.
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows, Came more and more and fought on part and part, Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
I am pale, Charmian.
But I will wed thee in another key, With pomp, with triumph, and with reveling.
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it, And yet I would it were to give again.
How goes the night, boy?
Return you to my sister.
His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.
Is not the leaf turned down Where I left reading?
Ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen, I would change my humanity with a baboon.
Nay, if you strive— But half an hour!
If I do so, it will be of more price Being spoke behind your back than to your face.
Oh, these flaws and starts, Impostors to true fear, would well become A woman’s story at a winter’s fire, Authorized by her grandam.
Well, I’ll break in.
As you are old and reverend, should be wise.
Your wife would give you little thanks for that If she were by to hear you make the offer.
Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.
There is some strange thing toward, Edmund.
The pale companion is not for our pomp.
I will go on the slightest errand now to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on.
So did I too, and he swore he would marry her tonight.
Fled this way, sir, when by no means he could— Pursue him, ho!
When was it she last walked?
I serve the king, On whose employment I was sent to you.
Be warned by me, then
There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice Proposing with the Prince and Claudio.
What, up and down, carved like an apple tart?
A noble duke, in nature As in name.
Your Highness told me I should post before.
And when your honors mean to solemnize The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you Even at that time I may be married too.
And the rarest that e'er came there.
Thou naughty knave, what trade?
The adventurous knight shall use his foil and target, the lover shall not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in peace, the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o' th' sear, and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for ’t.
My life upon her faith!—Honest Iago, My Desdemona must I leave to thee.
Did you know him?
Yet this is your harmless fairy, monster.
Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?
Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.
This is some priory.
Why, this would make a man a man of salt, To use his eyes for garden water-pots, Ay, and laying autumn’s dust.
Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds In ranks and squadrons and right form of war, Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol.
Are his wits safe?
Persever, counterfeit sad looks, Make mouths upon me when I turn my back, Wink each at other, hold the sweet jest up— This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.
What, will you walk with me about the town And then go to my inn and dine with me?
If you will see it, follow me.
We cannot fight for love as men may do.
Oh, damn her, damn her!
Tis a good silling, I warrant you, or I will change it.
Let not the heavens hear these telltale women Rail on the Lord’s anointed.
Tis so.
Stop it, Marcellus.
Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.
It hangs like flax on a distaff.
Husband, I’ll dine above with you today, And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
Within this three mile may you see it coming; I say, a moving grove.
Let me be satisfied.
Romans, countrymen, and lovers!
His father was called Philip of Macedon, as I take it.
Spoke like a tall man that respects thy reputation.
That’s my sister.
This lion is a very fox, for his valor.
Friends to this ground.
O, welcome, father!
Good night, good night.
There is means, madam.
For this night, to bed, and dream on the event.
By Jeshu, I am your Majesty’s countryman, I care not who know it.
Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
Neighbors, God speed.
Oh, ominous!
Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.
I’ll wear none but this.
Do it at once, Or thy precedent services are all But accidents unpurposed.
Not a false gallop.
If I dream not, thou art Emilia.
You were kneeled to and importuned otherwise By all of us, and the fair soul herself Weighed between loathness and obedience, at Which end o' th' beam should bow.
You have among you many a purchased slave, Which—like your asses and your dogs and mules— You use in abject and in slavish parts Because you bought them.
And cries aloud, “Tarry, my cousin Suffolk.
Abominable villain!
Well then, now Have you considered of my speeches?
I have almost forgot the taste of fears.
Why?
Tell your piteous heart There’s no harm done.
Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying—a place in the commonwealth—as which of you shall not?
The air Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself Unto our gentle senses.
What heir of York is there alive but we?
That’s two of his weapons.
But, as they say, to hear music the general does not greatly care.
God’s my life, where’s the Sexton?
Dear lady— Give me leave, beseech you.
For that he dares us to ’t.
Now I feed myself With most delicious poison.
Let me see his eyes, That, when I note another man like him, I may avoid him.
Peaseblossom.
Because they are not eight?
Come, my lord.
She was too good for me.
Good night, good brother.
I am sorry.
Be ruled by me.
You shall not seal to such a bond for me!
The dew is raw and cold.
And his unbookish jealousy must construe Poor Cassio’s smiles, gestures, and light behavior Quite in the wrong.—How do you now, lieutenant?
Why, your lieutenant, Cassio.
I have used it, nuncle, ever since thou madest thy daughters thy mothers.
If it assume my noble father’s person, I’ll speak to it, though Hell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace.
Will you hear the letter?
Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.
I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
Say’st me so, friend?
When ’s god’s asleep, he’ll rob his bottle.
