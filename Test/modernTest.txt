Sir, I wouldn’t say I was your friend, but I’ve praised you when you deserved ten times more praise than I gave.
make your eyes jump out of their sockets, and your hair stand on end like porcupine quills.
I don’t care what you think of me.
He left to fetch a necklace and he promised to bring it to the Porcupine, where I was dining with Balthasar.
If I took the kingdom from your sons, I’ll give it to your daughter to make up for it.
Come on, boy.  
Please be quiet.
Soon we will toast around the table.
It’s a monster!
Who’s the ruler here?
Conrade, I say!
No, and she swears she never will.
In Rome, Madam.
If this isn’t what you’ve been hoping for, I have no more to say except that you ought to say goodbye to Bianca forever.
The count’s messenger, Cesario.
But God forbid he says no to us!
What?
If I’m telling the truth like a fool in saying all this, whip the first person who thinks I sound foolish.
If you don’t, if I’m left alone, I swear I’ll have that legal expert as my bedfellow.
You could not prevent her from dying someday, but heaven will give her eternal life.
Well,        Aren’t I right, Jephthah, old man?
Our wedding banquet will become a sad burial feast.
How are you, my pretty Bianca?
No, my good lord.
It’s come again.
How’s the night going, boy?
He certainly is.
Curse you all, you’re all murderers and traitors!
I can’t ask you to make my daughter live—that’s impossible—but I beg you both to tell the people of Messina that she was innocent when she died.
What is my nation?
Gracious brother, I will go with them.
I’m sure nobody would have any reason to fight with me.
Maybe, but you’re wrinkled all the same.
What a tedious wait!
God bless you, my friend, and your music too.
I haven’t spoken to him since I sent him away from the marketplace earlier.
What a crazy island this is.
I’m not a doddering old fool who brags about the things he did when he was young, and what he would do now if he weren’t so old.
Don’t shed even one tear.
They’ll set their watches to whatever time we say.
That’s Cassio’s voice.
Two or three men are groaning.
The king has bet six Barbary horses, and he has prepared six French rapiers and daggers with all their accessories.
Any minute.
You keep cramming words into my ears that I don’t want to hear.
What are they doing on the road?
Now please leave me alone.
Then know that from my soul I love your daughter.
Didn’t great Caesar bleed for the sake of justice?
Good, sir?
Let him be for a bit.
Delighted to stay?
This is for your master’s sake, not mine.
We were pushed out of power by evil deeds, as you call them.
Get out of here, you blathering peasant!
Here, take the ring.
Excuse me, young man, how do I get to the Jew’s residence?
Show your slaves how mad you are, and make your servants tremble.
Ah, how will this all turn out?
My lord, you used to like me.
I’m afraid you’ll keep going until then.
That counts for everything.
And since our quarrel is with his future behavior, not what he does now, I must frame the argument like this
For the same thing.
Oh, and then at the very next turn, don’t turn left or right, but turn down and around to the Jew’s house.
But don’t kill my sister and her royal sons, be satisfied, dear God, with our blood, which is being spilled unjustly, as you know.
If he hears you, you’ll make him angry.
If Hamlet makes the first or second hit, or gets back at Laertes by making the third hit, then let my soldiers give him a military salute.
Romeo?
I wish you well.
I’ll make Oliver find him.
What is the tyrant Macbeth doing?
My lord, my lord— I don’t want to hear any more about it.
Then you should offer the gods a sacrifice to show your thanks.
Nonsense.
Demand.
Don’t you, Dromio?
My dear fool, because my brother died.
Also—I’ve kept my sword unsheathed since I saw this—in front of the Capitol I met a lion who looked at me and strutted by without bothering to attack me.
I’ll tell him, my lord.
Hey, Brabantio!
And what am I supposed to do in Illyria?
Yes.
Well, I’m going to break in.
I flashed about faster than lightning.
Yes sir, I’m fairly witty.
You, Nick Bottom, have been cast as Pyramus.
I’ll bet we’re both thinking the same thing, master.
dusk and all night long sleeps in peace.
I won’t break this promise.
Hey, lady!
I don’t like that.
Yes, that’s it.
Do you hear, my friend?
This box was tested in the fire seven times.
Listen but don’t speak to it.
It’s a deal.
You’ll have to woo Bianca like the rest.
Musicians, come in!
You would run away from a bear, but if the only way to run was into the stormy ocean, you’d turn around and confront the bear.
I hear you say “proud” and “I thank you,” and then “no thank you” and “not proud,” you spoiled little girl.
I’ll bandy you about and overwhelm you with my cleverness.
Not in the stocks, fool.
Yes, why shouldn’t she?
Please don’t ruin any more trees by carving love poems on their barks.
I am bound by oath, so please forgive me.
I have no power over you.
The Moor’s mind has already become infected with my poisonous suggestions.
My letters say there are a hundred and seven ships.
You are, but you don’t know it yet.
Why do you keep these talents behind a curtain?
Say it again—just one word, and my hand, which killed your lover out of love, will kill your far truer lover.
What are you going to do?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
That’s good, Lion!
Both?
Find him and tell him to come here.
In this house lives a man who despises all that is good in you.
A jealous woman, a jealous woman!
And I followed him because I loved him.
Your shoes are in pretty bad shape.
The court awards it and the law authorizes it.
No, if you can’t adjust to political changes, you’ll suffer for it.
Good morning, Brutus.
If I can just get him to drink one more glass after what he’s drunk already, he’ll be as argumentative and eager to fight as a little dog.
Yes, I’ll grant you that.
What does Lord Stanley say?
If I’d been a god I would’ve let the sea sink inside the earth before it had a chance to swallow up that ship and all the people it was carrying.
Tell the king what was happening in the battle when you left it.
I swear by my sword, which killed the Shah of Persia and a Persian prince and defeated the Sultan Suleiman three times, that I would face the meanest-looking warriors on earth.
Come, bring me to them.
I didn’t take any more pains bringing this message than you took pains in thanking me.” That’s like saying, “Any thing I do for you is as easy as saying ‘thank you.’” If this doesn’t move me to take pity on her, I’m a horrible person.
Where are you, keeper?
Is that enough of an answer?
If I had three ears I’d listen with all three.
John Duke of Norfolk and Thomas Earl of Surrey will lead the horsemen and foot soldiers.
The king is not responsible for it.
That makes you an even bigger villain.—Well, throw him out, and have my officers seize his house and lands.
Stop, even if only to kill me.
I’ve done no more to Caesar than you will do to me.
Return to the gracious duke, good Catesby.
No?
Let me see Philostrate.
Eyes, do you see?
By that kind of logic, I should hate Orlando, since my father hates his father.
No, from the moon, I’m telling you.
Into my grave.
Oh wicked wall, through which I don’t see any happiness!
He’s changed a great deal.
When grown-ups teach little children, they do it gently and easily.
Whoever is already married (except one person I know) will stay married—all but one person.
My message is not for anyone else to hear, my lady.
Oh, my dear mistress, I won’t be able to finish this work until sunset at the earliest.
Or is he on his horse?
Will you two help them get ready?
Oh, no, that was my lady’s voice.
Who did it?
I have an adventurous fairy who’ll go seek out the squirrel’s secret stash and get you some fresh nuts.
Go, then, mother, to your daughter.
There isn’t any other way, unless you took on another form and became someone else.
His youngest daughter, the beautiful Bianca, is the jewel of my life, and he keeps her hidden away from me and other rivals for her hand.
Did you call for me, your Worship?
Please, master, tell me.
Is that true?
Gone?
Cleopatra recognizes your greatness and accepts your authority.
How are you doing, Charles?
My dear lady— Please let me say something, I’m begging you.
Sing it tonight.
I’d rather get a husband from your father.
Did I work to make him king for this?
It’s bad news when a country is ruled by a child.
Fine!” he says.
Let me wipe it off first.
So, the man would talk half as much as Benedick and be half as serious as Don John— And if he were handsome, agile, and rich, too, he could have any woman in the world—all he’d need was her good will.
I’ll kiss your hand, and with that I leave you.
I won’t say no to you, but let it be known that I’m only doing this after a lot of persuasion and to save your life —I hear you were quickly wasting away without me.
That braggart, punk villain who fights like he learned swordsmanship from a manual!
If I could beg others to change their minds, begging would convince me, too.
Yes, and a brave one, who dares to look at something that would frighten the devil.
If you don’t like him you should quit.
Don’t stand there shocked.
Heaven keep you safe!
If you send them word that you won’t come, they might change their minds.
We might as well send orders to the whale to come ashore as try to restore order in soldiers carried away with their looting.
Not explicitly, but so what?
I have to ask you, as a favor, not to let on that you recognize me until the time is right.
Oh, dear!
I’ll meet you there.
Calphurnia’s face is pale, and Cicero’s eyes are as red and fiery as they get when senators are arguing with him at the Capitol.
Who’s winning?
Nothing, my lord, or if I did—I don’t know what.
Never, my lord.
The messenger arrived on my watch and is unloading his mules at your tent.
I thought you were resolved to do this.
My employer is as good as yours.
I’m well, and probably will be for a while, as I hear that four feasts are being prepared. 
Give me your blessing.
I will leave here for Verona tonight.
Look behind you, my lord.
Start the fire, good Curtis.
Brother, I’m giving you good advice.
Away, away, be gone.
To cut my penalty from that bankrupt man over there.
One more time, we proclaim this publicly
Sir, I tell you we believe you’re both lying criminals.
Listen, listen!
I’ll always be loyal to you, sir.
I see you’re all determined to gang up on me for a few laughs.
How is my noble lord?
But God forgive me for bragging.
Here.
What are they doing in the north when they should be in the west serving their king?
To get used to the life you’ll most likely be leading soon, get rid of your low-class trappings.
What?
Therefore, drink up.—Servant-monster, drink a toast to me.
Yes, and she was mild too.
I’ve always had great respect for your destiny.
Yes, he knew about it the whole time.
If a bloody head counts as a hurt, then you hurt me.
Not of killing him, because I have a warrant for it, but of being damned for killing him, which no warrant can protect me from.
I’ll go tell the king about this.
He’s near death, and Roderigo’s dead already.
I’ll tell twenty lies like that, so men will think I graduated from school at least a year ago.
Your grace, the person who is going to deliver the prologue is ready.
I’m going to take it from you now.
That’s not how I do business.
Now please listen, sir.
Let’s go gather our jewels and money.
Bring the fancy clothes out of my house, to use as bait to catch these thieves.
My sister is all those things, or else she should be.
God will free you from blame.
To put it plainly, I’m afraid I’m not quite sane.
What’s this?
Whatever kind you want, I guess.
I want to take the love I had for my cousin and take it out on the body of the man who killed him.
Let my sorrow have the upper hand.
That’s what I’m doing.
No.
These crisscrossing laces do cut off the circulation in my legs a bit, but who cares?
Well, eventually God will send him some more hair, if he thanks Him.
I’ll wait over here.
Yes, you would beg, if you were in my position.
Are Englishmen really such heavy drinkers?
Then let the rain come down.
Most mighty sovereign, you have no reason to doubt my friendship.
Good morning, Prince; good morning, Claudio.
Do something about it, then.
Madam, keep up hope.
How are you?
Listen to this.
I’ll keep my promise just as if you really were Rosalind.
They’re ready, my lord.
Oh, let us be merciful anyway.
But his investments are uncertain right now.
Take me.
Well, if it wasn’t her, I don’t know.
We haven’t yet encountered that danger, and the best thing to do is avoid it entirely.
No.
You’ve killed an innocent woman, and you’re going to pay dearly for her death.
My heart’s too sad for long goodbyes.
Dress me up in motley.
A friend.
Don’t wake her.
He’s a king, a king!
Your request came at a time when the poisonous effects of reveling caused me to be unaware of my own actions.
Den it shall also content me.
They are his dung, and he their beetle.
Luck and Antony separate here and now.
That is, if we ever want to return to being rivals for Bianca’s love.
I changed my mind.
Yes, Lepidus.
There was no need to tell me to get out of there.
Her name is Portia.
Prove that the men you call your fathers did truly conceive you.
You armor my heart.
Enough, enough.
They probably received warning about how much I stirred up the people.
Tell her you heard us, and that she should sneak into the arbor where the crisscrossing branches overhead keep the honeysuckles out of the sun.
Where is my wife?
I don’t really want to do this, but he’s given me good reasons.
Oh, please, tell us, sir.
Cheer yourself.
Out in the world, I’m like a drop of water, trying to find a drop that matches in the whole wide ocean.
No, you should tell him to hold his hands!
Here is some money for you to kill me immediately.
If a man’s brain were in his feet, wouldn’t it be susceptible to frostbite?
Sir, I can’t.
What, you’re leaving it with Lysander?
No, instead I’ll go to Benedick and advise him to fight his emotions.
Actually, I should.
We’ll eat at her place.
I’m sick, Charmian.
Look how flushed the actor is, with tears in his eyes.
Damn it!
They shout for joy.
You should have run up to her, unleashed a few excellent quips invented on the spot, and rendered the young man speechless.
My girlfriend has beautiful white hands, and great warriors aren’t  Ha, ha!
It will be made even heavier soon—by the weight of a man.
He refuses to admit what everyone else knows.
If there were anything inside their heads, they could never wear such heavy helmets.
Go ahead and ask her.
Tell me what you did with the king’s ship, the sailors, and the other ships.
If you prick us with a pin, don’t we bleed?
Hurry, send someone immediately!
So please, old friend, give us some good advice.
But it wasn’t until this afternoon that he broke out into violence.
You call this house dark?
I had no idea she was cheating on me.
I’m begging you, good Mercutio, let’s call it a day.
Sister, I have a lot to say about things that concern us both.
Listen!
Do you doubt I’ll write?
You don’t want to eat, sir?
I’m seizing your lands and all that you possess until your brother gives testimony that absolves you of any guilt.
If he’s nearby, I want an explanation.
Now I see it’s true.
His wife probably did it on purpose because she knows what kind of fits he’s having.
If you still feel so affectionate toward her, then why not give her permission to cheat on you?
Then God be praised, it  Petruchio, do whatever you like.
Don’t let them know fear.
But he’s young, and as long as he’s too young to become king, Richard, the duke of Gloucester, has power over him.
If the future turns out as I hope it will, I’m all set for success.
My lord loves you.
The bridegroom is already here.
I kiss his dirty shoe, and from the bottom of my heart I love the lovely boy.
Has anyone seen Cesario?
If we meet again, then we’ll smile indeed.
to have a stupid wife.
He’s only known you for three days, but he’s already treating you like a close friend.
To celebrate a marriage of true love, and give a gift to the lovers.
No, I know that you’re Signior Lucentio.
The night’s too rough for humans to bear.
It was love that performed these miracles.
Like hell she is!
That’s how intense things like love are quickly destroyed.
Let me play the lion too.
Goodbye.
Thank you, sir.
Shush, sir, please!
Is this the same Moor whom the senate considers so capable?
Hortensio, have you come to break up the fight?
What in the world do you call this, tailor!
What quality is that, my lord?
See, the snail already has its horns, which prevents nasty rumors from spreading about his wife’s infidelity.
Greetings, good general!
Your mother was extremely virtuous, and she said you were my daughter.
Angels are still bright even though Lucifer, the brightest angel, fell from heaven.
So, in that case, tell me who’s next in line to inherit the kingdom of Naples?
Now, please, I beg you, don’t work so hard.
My daughter is still very young.
Then your lips will feel them more quickly.
I’m sorry you’re leaving my father like this.
She can’t stand to hear about getting a husband.
You’re in a hurry, are you?
But she’s modest and ladylike too.
If he’s been spending his leisure time in lustful pursuits, then he’ll be punished with venereal diseases, and that’s his business.
Swords don’t frighten me.
My Lord of Cambridge and my good Lord of Masham and you, my noble knight, what do you think?
The Lord keep him from the title of king!
What, are you crazy?
Where is Gloucester?
Your Highness told me to ask for my commission today.
Oh, dear God, don’t let me go mad!
Be patient, because the prize I’m leading you to will make you forget how smelly you are now.
Please, educate me.
Enough to buy everything you have declared.
And I’ll sing it for the duke in the intermission of a play.
My words are dull.
I’m not really Litio.
Now you’re Romeo.
I think his soul’s in hell, my lady.
Has your heart cooled toward me?
Your praise has beaten you home.
What’s the matter with you now?
Hold the friar too.
I accept that offer happily, madam.
You have all served me well, and kings are your peers.     
Farewell to both of you, dear teachers.
Brother, you’ve made a mistake.
And what should I give you that would be equal in value to this rare and precious gift?
Should we do that?
Master, is this Satan’s mistress?
If you and I don’t value her equally, it would be better for us to work out our differences without her.
Believe that you are a foolish little baby for believing these “offers” are something real.
Two of both kinds makes four.
That’s how someone who’s been murdered should look, and that’s how I look.
At five o'clock he’s going to pay me for it.
Oh, you’re wrong.
Has your lord given you any orders to negotiate with my face?
Then give it a nice welcome, as you would give to any stranger.
Oh, don’t ask me why I “need” them!
No, if you struggle with me— Just half an hour!
You’re asking me!
As clearly as I see you, my lord.
There’s only one body here.
Go to sleep, and I will wrap my arms around you.
And those who leave their valiant bones in France, dying like men though buried in your dunghills—they’ll be remembered, too.
Cesario is my name—your servant’s name—fair princess.
Then learn this from me
Let’s go!
Oh, if you could speak, I might hear you call Caesar an ass who’s been outsmarted!
He was more faithful to me than the sun is to the daytime.
Well, thank you.
If I repeated it to you, it would kill you as soon as you heard it.
Those who rush stumble and fall.
There’s always a breath of fresh air here.
I don’t really understand what you mean.
And, when I do marry, I swear, it will be Romeo, whom you know I hate, rather than Paris.
Your sweet brother wanted to come meet you, but his mother wouldn’t let him.
Whatever happens tonight, don’t talk about it.
But stop, I say.
Welcome, traveler.
When I strike, I’ll cry, “All or nothing!” Well put.
As for us, you know we are Antony’s, and he is Caesar’s.
Are you going to start eating worms and flies?
It would be a pretty stingy love if it could be counted and calculated.
But we can talk more about that tomorrow, when we’ll discuss matters of state that concern us both.
No, none at all.
I have often led you, now you must carry me, my good friends—and take my thanks for everything.
I’ll listen to Cassius, and we will compare their reasons.
His glory has not been diminished where he earned it, nor have those offenses for which he was killed been exaggerated.
Now all the late travellers are hurrying to reach their inns.
But why, why, why?
Carved it up and down like an apple tart?
Let me come clean.
We charge you, in the Prince’s name, to stop!
Now I’ve said it twice.
Fair sister, will you go with the princes or stay here with me?
You’re mistaken about all that.
Only you would look for a fight like that.
Against my will, I’ve been told to bring you in to dinner.” There’s a double meaning in that.
Keep an eye on him.
What can we do to find out if it’s true?
So this letter, which is so incredibly stupid and ignorant, isn’t going to scare him at all.
I don’t know what else it could be.
I’ll remember.
I don’t understand why they’re all here together.
Dear Celia—I already look much happier than I feel, but you want me to look even happier?
I’ll give it a try.
Has the storm passed?
Now I will have to send my humble proposal of peace to that young man.
Unpunished!
It’s sad, but Iago knows she had sex with Cassio a thousand times.
I’m the man she wants.
You’re up early.
It was incredible!
Mutton?
That’s how sound a man you appeared.
My husband.
He was dressed so oddly too!
If I weren’t forbidden to tell you the secrets of 
Richard of York, how are you doing, my loving brother?
So much for our plan.
What’s the matter?
Some  Now listen, either give me my ring or give me the necklace.
Believe me, I’d rather have lost a purse full of gold coins.
Nothing but “little” and “short”!— Why are you letting her insult me like this?
Even good men have bad luck.
Come on, you turtle!
Any news from Genoa?
How could he have even entertained these thoughts in his heart?
Are you good or evil?
Weren’t you ordered, on penalty of— Why Dover?—Let him answer that question first.
He’s already done so.
I know her by her walk.
That’s the way great men ought to endure great losses.
He couldn’t see you.
It’s entirely possible.
My soul will keep yours company on the way to heaven.
Go ahead and say you don’t love me, but not so bitterly.
Wouldn’t he be a comfort to us in our travels?
It is, my lord.
Come here, ma'am.
That’s “Ninus’s grave,” man.
I mean I will live on whatever I get, like birds do.
Good to see you, Master Antipholus.
There’s something else.
Have some patience, please.
If he wakes up before we kill him, he’ll never stop punishing us.
But how will we keep it from being passed now, my lord?
By running fast.
No, come on, one more time.
We’ve been looking for him everywhere.
Hello, Cassio!
I don’t think so, my lord.
All I ever did was tell him how hurtful and bad it was.
Do you recognize the handwriting?
Those are only two of his weapons.
From the highest to the lowest of you, I bid you a hearty welcome.
Whenever you like.
I can see what’s in broad daylight.
If there were two men like you, pretty soon there’d be none because the two of you would kill each other.
I’m not insulting you.
We’re searching on land, but he’s lost in the sea.
Plain and simple loyalty doesn’t make anyone act phony.
Sunday is just around the corner.
Aren’t I your Rosalind?
I wish I had not lived long enough to see him die.
It’s difficult to bring two friends together, but even mountains can be moved together by earthquakes.
